## Minimal Requirements

Core:

 - GNU make (try gmake if make fails)
 - GCC 3 or later

## Optional Requirements

SSL support:

 - openssl 0.9.7d or later (try installing openssl-dev, openssl-devel or
   libssl-dev)

modperl:

 - This needs perl and its bundled libperl

modpython:

 - This needs perl(!) and python's bundled libpython

saslauth:

 - This module needs cyrus-sasl2

## Installing ZNC

Installation is done with the `./configure ; make ; make install` commands.

If you are building from git, you will need to run `./autogen.sh` first to produce the `configure` script.
Note that this requires `automake` to be installed.

You can use
	./configure --help
if you want to get a list of options, though the defaults should be suiting
most needs. After you compiled it with make (or gmake if make doesn't work) you
can install it with
	make install
though you don't need to as ZNC supports in-place execution.

## Setting up znc.conf

For setting up a configuration file in `~/.znc` you can simply do
	znc --makeconf
or
	./znc --makeconf
for in-place execution.

If you are using SSL you should do
	znc --makepem

## Special config options

When you create your ZNC configuration file via --makeconf, you are asked two
questions which might not be easy to understand.

> Number of lines to buffer per channel

How many messages should be buffered for each channel. When you connect to ZNC
you get a buffer replay for each channel which shows what was said last. This
option selects the number of lines this replay should consist of. Increasing
this can greatly increase ZNC's memory usage if you are hosting many users.
The default value should be fine for most setups.

> Would you like to keep buffers after replay?

If this is disabled, you get the buffer playback only once and then it is
deleted. If this is enabled, the buffer is not deleted. This may be useful if
you regularly use more than one client to connect to ZNC.

## Using ZNC

Once you have started ZNC you can connect with your favorite IRC-client to ZNC.
You should use `username:password` as the server password (e.g. `/pass user:pass`).

Once you are connected you can do `/msg *status help` for some commands.
Every module you have loaded (`/msg *status listmods`) should additionally provide
	/msg *modulename help

## File Locations

In its data dir (`~/.znc` is default) ZNC saves most of its data. The only
exception are modules and module data, which are saved in `<prefix>/lib/znc`
and `<prefix>/share/znc`, and the znc binary itself.
More modules (e.g. if you install some later) can be saved in
`<data dir>/modules` (-> `~/.znc/modules`).

In the datadir are only two files:

- `znc.pid` - The pid of the currently running ZNC instance.
- `znc.pem` - This is the server certificate ZNC uses for listening and is created
 with `znc --makepem`.

These directories are also in there:

- configs - Contains `znc.conf` (ZNC's config file) and backups of older configs.
- modules - ZNC also looks in here for a module.
- moddata - Global modules save their settings here.
  (e.g. webadmin saves the current skin name in here)
- users   - This is per-user data and mainly contains just a moddata directory.

## ZNC's config file

This file shouldn't be too hard too understand. An explanation of all the
items can be found on the [Configuration](http://wiki.znc.in/Configuration)-Page.
Warning: better not to edit config, while ZNC is running.

To rehash the config file, you can send ZNC SIGHUP via
	pkill -SIGHUP znc
or you can login to ZNC and use
	/msg *status rehash

If you changed some settings while ZNC is running, a simple
	pkill -SIGUSR1 znc
will make ZNC rewrite its config file. Alternatively you can use this:
	/msg *status saveconfig

## Writing own modules

You can write your own modules in either C++, python or perl.

C++ modules are compiled by either saving them in the modules source dir and
running make or with the znc-buildmod shell script.

For additional info look in the wiki:

- [Writing Modules](http://wiki.znc.in/WritingModules)
- [Module Hooks](http://wiki.znc.in/ModuleHooks)

Perl modules are loaded through the global module [ModPerl](http://wiki.znc.in/Modperl).

Python modules are loaded through the global module [ModPython](http://wiki.znc.in/Modpython).
