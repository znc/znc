# ZNC 1.6.0 (2015-02-12)

## New

* Switch versioning scheme to <major>.<minor>.<patch>.
* Add settings for which SSL/TLS protocols to use (SSLProtocols), which ciphers to enable (SSLCiphers). By default TLSv1+ are enabled, SSLv2/3 are disabled. Default ciphers are what Mozilla advices: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28default.29
* Validate SSL certificates.
* Allow clients to specify an ID as part of username (user[@identifier][/network]). Currently not used, but modules can use it.
* Add alias module for ZNC-side command interception and processing.
* Support character encodings with separate settings for networks, and for clients. It replaces older charset module, which didn't work well with webadmin, log and other modules.
* Support X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, used with new TrustedProxy setting.
* Add URIPrefix option for HTTP listeners, used with reverse proxy.
* Store query buffers per query the same way it's done for channels, add new option AutoClearQueryBuffer.

* Allow wildcards in arguments of Help commands of *status and various modules.
* Support IRCv3.2 batches, used for buffer playbacks.
* Support IRCv3.2 self-message.
* Remove awaynick module. It's considered bad etiquette.
* Add JoinDelay setting, which allows a delay between connection to server, and joining first channel. By default it joins immediately after connect.
* Make Detach, EnableChan and DisableChan commands of *status accept multiple channels.
* znc-buildmod: Build output to the current working directory.
* Wrap long lines in tables (e.g. in Help or ListAvailMods commands).
* Support ECDHE if available in OpenSSL.
* Report ZNC version more consistently, add HideVersion setting, which hides ZNC version from public.
* Bump compiler requirements to support C++11. This means GCC 4.7+, Clang 3.2+, SWIG 3.0.0+.

# ZNC 1.0 (2012-11-07)

## The Big News
Multiple networks per user
Think about new users as "user groups", while new networks are similar to old users.

To login to ZNC, use user/network:password as password, or user/network as username. Also, you can switch between different networks on the fly using the /znc JumpNetwork command.

When you first run ZNC 1.0, it will automatically convert your config and create a network called "default" for each user. Settings from each user are moved into these "default" networks. When you log into ZNC without setting a network, the "default" network will automatically be chosen for you.

Users can create new networks up to an admin-configurable limit. By default, this limit is one network per user.

Existing user-per-network setups can be migrated to the new multinetwork setup using the /znc MoveNetwork command.

You can see a list of networks via /znc ListNetworks and /znc ListAllUserNetworks.

## Timezones
Timezone can now be configured by name, e.g. "GMT-9", or "Europe/Madrid". Old TimezoneOffset setting (which was the number of hours between the server's timezone and the user's timezone) is deprecated and should not be used anymore. Its old value is lost. The reason for this change is that the old TimezoneOffset was not trivial to count and often broke during switches to/from daylight savings time.

So if you previously used the TimezoneOffset option, you now have to configure your timezone again (via the webadmin or controlpanel module).

## No more ZNC-Extra
Most modules from ZNC-Extra are now enabled in the usual installation. It was pointless to have them shipped in the tarball, but requiring user to add some weird flags to ./configure.

Antiidle, fakeonline and motdfile modules are dropped.

Away module is renamed to awaystore to better explain its meaning.

## Fixes
* Don't try IPv6 servers when IPv6 isn't available. Use threads for non-blocking DNS instead of c-ares.
* Fix debug output of identfile.
* Don't forward WHO replies with multi-prefix to clients which don't support multi-prefix
* Send nick changes to clients before we call the OnNick module hook
* Don't connect to SSLed IRC servers when ZNC is compiled without SSL support
* Fix check for visibility support in the compiler
* Fix compilation on cygwin again, including modperl and modpython
* Support parting several channels at once
* Fix a crash in admin (now controlpanel) module
* Fix webadmin to deny setting a bindhost that is not on the global list of allowed bindhosts.
* Fix using empty value for defaults in user page in webadmin.

## Minor Stuff
* Rename admin module to controlpanel to make it clearer that it's not the same as admin flag of a user.
* Add protection from flood. If you send multiple lines at once, they will be slowed down, so that the server will not disconnect ZNC due to flood. It can be configured and can be completely turned off. Default settings are: 1 line per second, first 4 lines are sent at once.
* Modules can support several types now: a module can be loaded as a user module, as a network module and as a global module, if the module supports these types.
* Rename (non-)KeepBuffer to AutoClearChanBuffer
* Process starttls numeric
* Improvements to modperl, modpython, modtcl.
* Add timestamps to znc --debug

* Modified description field for bouncedcc module to explain what the module actually does.
* nickserv: add support for nickserv requests on wenet.ru and rusnet.
* send 422 event if MOTD buffer is empty
* route_replies: Handle much more replies
* Clear text colors before appending timestamps to buffer lines, add space before AppendTimestamp for colorless lines.

## Fixes

* The traffic stats caused a NULL pointer dereference if there were any unauthenticated connections. CVE-2010-2488 (r2051)
* Csocket had a bug where a wrong error message was generated and one that caused busy loops with c-ares. (r2053)

# ZNC 0.090 (2010-06-06)

## Upgrading from previous versions

## Errors during start-up
The shell, email and imapauth modules have been moved from the regular module set to the "extra" set, you have to use --enable-extra with ./configure to compile them.

So, to fix these errors, edit the znc.conf file in ~/.znc/configs and don't load those modules, or recompile znc with extra.

### WebMods
While previously only the "webadmin" provided an HTTP server/interface, the HTTP server is now integrated into ZNC's core. This means that all modules (not only webadmin) can now provide web pages. Examples shipping with ZNC are lastseen, stickychan and notes. Old-style module arguments to webadmin will be automatically converted to the new syntax.

Please note that the WebMods interface uses session cookies instead of 'Basic' HTTP authentication.

All URLs to webadmin's settings pages have changed. Please adjust your scripts etc. if necessary.

### Running without installing
If you want to run ZNC without doing make install, i.e. if you want to run it from the source dir, you will have to add --enable-run-from-source as an argument to ./configure. You do not have to care about this if you use a --prefix= or if you install ZNC system-wide.

### I upgraded and WebAdmin/WebMods is acting weird, Log Out does not work.
Starting with 0.090, ZNC uses cookies instead of HTTP Basic authentication. If your browser is still sending the Basic credentials to ZNC, e.g. because you have saved them in a bookmark, or password manager, or simply haven't restarted your browser in a while, those will continue to work, even after you click the Log Out button.

To fix this, remove any user:pass@host portions from your bookmarks, remove all entries for ZNC's web interface from your password manager, and restart your browser.

# ZNC 0.066 (2009-02-24)

There was a privilege escalation bug in webadmin which could allow all ZNC users to write to znc.conf. They could gain shell access through this. (r1395) (r1396)

This is CVE-2009-0759.

## Affected versions
This bug affects all versions of ZNC which include the webadmin module. Let's just say this affects every ZNC version, ok? ;)

## Who can use this bug?
First, ZNC must have the webadmin module loaded and accessible to the outside. Now any user who already has a valid login can exploit this bug.

An admin must help (unknowingly) to trigger this bug by reloading the config.

## Impact
Through this bug users can write arbitrary strings to the znc.conf file.

Unprivileged ZNC users can make themselves admin and load the shell module to gain shell access.
Unprivileged ZNC users can temporarily overwrite any file ZNC has write access to via ISpoof. This can be used to overwrite ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and gain shell access.
Unprivileged ZNC users can permanently truncate any file to which ZNC has write access via ISpoof. ZNC never saves more than 1kB for restoring the ISpoofFile.

## How can I protect myself?
Upgrade to ZNC 0.066 or newer or unload webadmin.

## What happens?
Webadmin doesn't properly validate user input. If you send a manipulated POST request to webadmin's edit user page which includes newlines in e.g. the QuitMessage field, this field will be written unmodified to the config. This way you can add new lines to znc.conf. The new lines will not be parsed until the next rehash or restart.

This can be done with nearly all input fields in webadmin. Because every user can modify himself via webadmin, every user can exploit this bug.

## Thanks
Thanks to cnu for finding and reporting this bug.

## New stuff
* Added the admin module. (r1379) (r1386)
* savebuff and away no longer ask for a password on startup. (r1388)
* Added the fail2ban module. (r1390)

## Fixes
* savebuff now also works with KeepBuffer turned off. (r1384)

* modperl used huge amounts of memory after some time. This is now fixed. (r1357)
* shell now generates error messages if e.g. fork() fails. (r1369)
