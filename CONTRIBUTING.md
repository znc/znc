    * Please ensure that you are on the latest version in case the bug you
      are reporting is already fixed.
    * If you did some custom modification to ZNC, please make sure that
      the bug isn't caused by that modification.
    * Please include the following information:
        * OS/distribution version
        * `/znc version`
    * If you are reporting a crash, please see [the debugging page]Â on

    * If you are reporting an issue with connectivity, please run ZNC
      in debug mode and include the relevant part of the output. To enable
      debug mode, run ZNC with the `-D` flag.
